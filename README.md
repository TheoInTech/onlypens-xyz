## üöÄ MVP Scope

### üéØ Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Wallet connect (e.g., Coinbase Smart Wallet) or email login.
- **Role Selection**: Users choose to be either an Influencer or a Ghostwriter.
- **Dashboard**:
  - _creators_:
    - Post new briefs.
    - View and manage submitted drafts.
    - Approve submissions and release payments.
  - _Ghostwriters_:
    - Browse available briefs.
    - Submit drafts for assigned briefs.

  - This ensures content authenticity and maintains the influencer's brand voice.
- **Escrow System**: Funds are held in a smart contract and released upon approval of work.
- **Yield-Bearing Escrow**: Integrate with Base's Earn component to allow escrowed funds to generate yield until released.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Supabase (for storing briefs and AI matchmaking data)
- **Blockchain**: Base network
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (using Hardhat for development and deployment)
