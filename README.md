## üöÄ MVP Scope

### üéØ Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Wallet connect using Coinbase Smart Wallet.
- **Role Selection**: Users choose to be either a Creator or a Ghostwriter.
- **Gig Creation**: Create gig packages with an AI-assisted pricing and start inviting the best-matched ghostwriters
- **Dashboard**:
  - _creators_:
    - Post new gigs in packages (e.g. 2 Thread, 4 short-post, 4 image caption).
    - View and manage submitted drafts.
    - Approve submissions and release payments.
  - _ghostwriters_:
    - Accept gig invitations from creators
    - Submit drafts for accepted gigs.
    - Track earnings.
- **AI-Powered Tone Matching**:
  - creators provide sample content to capture their unique tone.
  - AI analyzes these samples to match them with ghostwriters whose writing style aligns closely.
  - This ensures content authenticity and maintains the influencer's brand voice.
- **Escrow System**: Funds are held in a smart contract and released upon approval of work.
- **Yield-Bearing Escrow**: Integrate with Base's Earn component to allow escrowed funds to generate yield until released.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Zod, Mantine UI
- **Backend**: Firebase's Firestore (for storing gigs metadata and AI matchmaking data)
- **Blockchain**: Base network
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (using Hardhat for development and deployment)
- **Indexing**: TheGraph Protocol's Subgraph

## üå± Future Enhancements

- **Long-Term Collaborations**: Enable creators to establish ongoing relationships with preferred ghostwriters aside from just a per-gig engagement.
- **Content Revision System**: Implement a structured revision process allowing creators to request changes and ghostwriters to submit updated versions.
- **Version History**: Maintain a comprehensive version history of all content, enabling easy comparison between drafts and tracking of changes.
- **Notification System**: Implement a comprehensive notification system to alert ghostwriters about new opportunities:
  - Real-time notifications for gig invitations and brief matches.
  - Email notifications for important updates and new opportunities.
  - In-app notification center to track all communications.
  - Customizable notification preferences allowing users to filter by opportunity type, budget range, and urgency.
  - Push notifications for mobile users to ensure timely responses to time-sensitive opportunities.
- **Reputation System**: Implement on-chain reputation scores for both creators and ghostwriters.
- **Commission-based Payments**: Implement a flexible royalty system allowing creators to offer ghostwriters a percentage of revenue generated from content, enabling profit-sharing arrangements alongside or instead of fixed payments.
- **Improved AI Matchmaking with Vector**: Improve matchmaking algorithms using advanced AI models and vector databases.

## üìú Smart Contracts

The OnlyPens platform utilizes the following smart contracts:

| Contract Name               | Contract Address                           | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OnlyPensHelpers             | 0x74f6F9aaB65920dE55CD499227Cb99aD86C02964 | Library contract containing helper functions for deliverable validation and other utility operations    |
| OnlyPens (Implementation)   | 0xC8F769515cf20B8Ba3b195Efc17DAc1Cd3a85b41 | Core contract containing the business logic for gig management, deliverables, and payment release       |
| CustomProxyAdmin            | 0xf92C590E5d2DF7E795293834d83CCb35a345b826 | Admin contract controlling the upgrade mechanism and permissions                                        |
| TransparentUpgradeableProxy | 0xAea48688cD175CC4dC269b0ceFB65597B5419900 | Proxy contract that users interact with, forwarding calls to the implementation while maintaining state |

The system uses the Transparent Proxy Pattern, allowing for future upgrades while preserving user data and contract state.
